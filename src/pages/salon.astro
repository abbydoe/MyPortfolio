        <p>
          The company that created her last website, took it down in demand for
          more payment. They initially told her she had to pay a one-time fee
          for her website, but after a year, they wanted her to pay again.

          <li>
            She had an in-person pay structure and customers would take
            advantage of this by receiving service and leaving without paying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Her client’s appointments got lost in her email because she used a
            contact form that people would fill out which sent to her email.
          </li>
          <li>
            She had unclear service pricing, so she received a lot of calls from
            clients asking pricing details.

        I invited 5 women who frequent salons to my Figjam file to see how they

          I showed her how it seamlessly integrated into her website, allowed
          her to add her brand colors and logo, and sent automatic reminders to
          her clients. It also worked with Stripe so she can accept a “Deposit”

        Despite this redesign solving her problems, she did not want to create a

        that made her initial website and paid the $300 fee for them to
        reinstate it. The Vercel app is still available, but the Calendly

        <li>
          Approach stakeholder meetings with a detailed plan and talking points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicate with the dev during the wireframe process, so you don’t
          create something they can’t or won’t code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes your design will be compromised due to time constraints or
          miscommunication in development, so communicate frequently!
